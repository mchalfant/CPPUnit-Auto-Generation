#Collects information from all source files and header files to autogenerate Unit Tests.

What is done so far:
   * Autogenerated Files for their retrospective Test Folders:
	* Makefile - Completed
	* Unit Test Class - Needs Verification
	* Unit Test Runner - Completed

   * Collecting Source file Includes, Source File Signature, and header abstractions.
     Works for both C and C++ declarations.
   * Working Template for TestMain.cpp

TODO:
   * Figure out a way to generate appropiate test data header for Unit Test Class
	* Will need to get enum data until a native data type is reached
      * Can use the include path in the template makefile for reference

Test Data Brainstorm:
   * Use a stack to check what level of abstraction the program is at
   *
